# COMP560-lab3
Comp560 lab03 Ray Tracing.

Keliang He, Xue Liu

Implementation Notes:
We implemented a torus, whose ray intersection is done by numerical method that performs a double interpolates within the bounding sphere. 
We also implemented an add light feature. 
You can remove objects by first selecting them in the drop-down menu, then hit the delete selected object.
Features of the object can be changed in the open property window menu.

Scenes:
1. An exhibition of all objects
2. Several balls between two mirrors to show reflection
3. Cornell box example showing refraction
4. Reflection between two balls

Unexpected revision:
We fixed a few bugs in the provided code. Please run our program using our codebase.
